            Line’s new Duet service combines chat bots, voice synthesis and natural language processing to create an automated reservation service for small and midsized businesses.

            “We have 1,000 AI engineers. That’s probably the most of any company in Japan,” Shin said.
            The company is also rolling out Line Mini, a tool that allows businesses owners to create apps for the platform without any knowledge of coding. The point-and-click tool offers access to payment, location and notification functions, and can be used to easily create e-commerce services such as loyalty programs.
